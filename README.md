# Fitness Hub — Simple static site

This is a small static website that explains what fitness is and provides basic 1-month, 2-month, and 3-month plans with daily basics and practical set/rep examples.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — simple JavaScript to switch between plans
- `README.md` — this file

How to use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Use the "Plan length" selector to view the 1-month / 2-month / 3-month plan.
4. Follow the daily basics and practical examples as a starting point; adapt to your schedule and fitness level.

Guidelines inside the site:
- Beginner recommendation: start with lower sets/reps and build consistency (20–45 min total daily).
- Strength template: 3 sets × 6–12 reps for most compound movements (beginners).
- Cardio template: 20–40 minutes steady or 10–20 min interval work.
- Mobility: 5–15 minutes daily to improve recovery and movement quality.

Safety:
- If you have any medical condition or pain, consult a healthcare professional before beginning a new exercise program.
- Warm up well before heavy or intense sessions. Prioritize form over load.

Feel free to edit the content or expand the site with additional pages, printable plans, or progress tracking.
